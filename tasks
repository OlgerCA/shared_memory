common: add an appropriate time and date representation
common: complete implementation of shared_buffer functions
consumer: get command-line arguments using optget: buffer (or file name) and mean waiting time.
consumer: use mmap to get a pointer to a SharedBuffer using the provided file name
consumer: increase consumer counter inside SharedBuffer
consumer: get semaphore instance using the provided name inside SharedBuffer
consumer: read messages until a termination message is read or p_id % 5 = message_key, using the provided waiting time. Print to the console each time a new message is read.
consumer: decrease consumer counter inside SharedBuffer and munmap
consumer: print report
finalizer: get command-line argument using optget: buffer (or file name)
finalizer: use mmap to get a pointer to a SharedBuffer using the provided file name
finalizer: call shared_buffer_set_inactive, and wait until there are no producers alive
finalizer: send one finalization message for each consumer that is alive and wait until all are finished
finalizer: munmap and release buffer (delete shared file)
initializer: get command-line arguments using optget: buffer (or file name) and queue size.
initializer: create a new mapping file of size = (sizeof(SharedBuffer) - sizeof(Message*) + sizeof(Message) * queueSize). Use the provided file name.
initializer: create a new named semaphore
initializer: use mmap to get a pointer to a SharedBuffer using the provided file name
initializer: initialize SharedBuffer and munmap
producer: get command-line arguments using optget: buffer (or file name) and mean waiting time.
producer: use mmap to get a pointer to a SharedBuffer using the provided file name
producer: increase producers counter inside SharedBuffer
producer: get semaphore instance using the provided name inside SharedBuffer
producer: create messages while SharedBuffer is active and using the provided waiting time. Print to the console each time a new message is created.
producer: decrease producers counter inside SharedBuffer and munmap
producer: print report
